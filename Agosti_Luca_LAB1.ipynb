I ran the notebook with the random seed \"2022\" and in that case I got a training loss of 2422 and a test loss of 1749. This brings me to belive that having this much variability in the estimation of the loss for two sets could be a consequence of a great dependency of our model from the initial random permutation of data. This could be improved by increasing the size of the initial dataset."
